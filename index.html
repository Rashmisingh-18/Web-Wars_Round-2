    <h1 class="h-primary">Welcome to Timeline of the history of the Web</h1>
    <p>
        Since its founding in 1989, the World Wide Web has touched the lives of billions of people around the world and
        fundamentally changed how we connect with others, the nature of our work, how we discover and share news and new
        ideas, how we entertain ourselves and how communities form and function.

        The timeline below is the beginning of an effort to capture both the major milestones and small moments that
        have shaped the Web since 1989.
